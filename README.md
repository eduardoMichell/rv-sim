![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/eduardoMichell/riscv-ui?label=Repo%20Size)

This project is a RISC-V processor implemented in JavaScript, allowing the execution of RISC-V assembly code from the RV32I instruction set directly through HTTP requests. It was developed with the objective of providing an accessible implementation, allowing students, enthusiasts and developers to experience and learn about this popular processor architecture.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to install [Angular 16](https://angular.io/) and [Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be able to initialize the front-end on your computer

### Tutorial
To begin running the frontend, follow these steps:

- Install the necessary dependencies by executing *npm install* in your terminal or command prompt.
- Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using the command *ng serve*.

This will launch the development server, and you'll be able to access your frontend application in your web browser at the default address http://localhost:4200/.
